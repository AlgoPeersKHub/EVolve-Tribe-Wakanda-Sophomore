# This repository contains the codes/program for the various hands-on projects for a 4-month STEAM project named EVolve

About The EVolve Project:

The EVolve project is an experiential program aimed at empowering the next generations of problem solvers with the essential skills and mindset required to address the urgent challenges of climate change, particularly in reducing carbon emissions from road vehicles. 

The project harnesses cutting-edge technologies like physical computing (using Raspberry Pi Pico W), 3D printing technology, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and the Internet of Things. These tools, along with applications building using MIT App Inventor, will used to develop clean energy technologies, promote the use of Electric Vehicles for  sustainable transportation practices, and work towards achieving negative carbon emissions.

Learners aged 11 to 14, [KS3], who have prior programming knowledge, will engage in experiential learning modules and draw inspiration from leading innovators to become the problem-solvers and changemakers of tomorrow to build technologies for negative carbon emissions.


#The EVolve Boot Camp provides young learners with essential skills, which include:

Engaging in hands-on exploration and implementation of clean energy and storage technologies through physical computing using Raspberry Pi Pico W, 3D printing, and Python programming.

Developing electric vehicles powered by clean energy sources for road transportation, utilizing physical computing with Raspberry Pi Pico W, Python programming, and robotics.

Leveraging emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and the Internet of Things to create smart electric vehicles for road transportation, enhancing sustainability and efficiency.
